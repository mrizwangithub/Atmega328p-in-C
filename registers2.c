/*
This file DOES NOT use any libraries provided with avr-gcc compiler.

Manipulating port to blink built in LED connected to Pin 13 which is internally controlled by PORT B.
PORTB is a set of pins controlled by a byte size (8bits) register having 
memory address 0x25. Memory addresses can be found in ATMega328p Datasheet section 13.4.

DDRB(Data direction register) at 0x24 is also a byte sized register dedicated to 
configure pins on PORTB either as input or output direction.
